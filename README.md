# [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/) in TypeScript

Use Bun to run, every server is listening on port 8888.

## 00 Smoke Test

a simple TCP Echo Service from RFC 862.

## 01 Prime Time

- a custom `readLines` function is handy

## 02 Means to an End

- a custom `SlidingBufferReader` is handy

## 03 Budget Chat

- implement a `LineReader` to read lines

## 04 Unusual Database Program

- NOTE: in Node, the "message" event always corresponds to a single UDP packet

## 05 Mob in the Middle

- I cann't believe how short the code is

## 06 Speed Daemon

- Need to write a client to send bytes to test the server, `bun run tools/tcp_hex_client.ts`
